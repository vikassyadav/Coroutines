         * GlobalScope.launch creates a NEW coroutine with its own Job.
         * This Job becomes the PARENT for all coroutines launched inside this block.
         *
         * Dispatcher.Main -> runs on Android main (UI) thread.
         *
         * ⚠️ GlobalScope is used here ONLY for learning/demo.
         * In real apps, prefer lifecycleScope or viewModelScope.
         *
         * When parent coroutine is cancelled, all children are automatically cancelled.
         Job.cancel() cancels the parent coroutine and all its children.
         it is also a type of finish and cancellation signal.

         * the parent waits for its children to finish before completing — unless they are cancelled.
         * A parent coroutine does not reach the Completed state until all its children either complete normally or are cancelled.

           📌 Important nuance:

           Parent waits for children

           But children don’t have to finish successfully

           Cancellation also counts as “finished”
